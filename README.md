# Number Guessing Game

A simple Java console game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

## How It Works
- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user enters guesses until the correct number is found.
- The program gives hints:
  - "Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
  - "Too low" if the guess is smaller.
- Displays how many attempts the player took.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**.
2. Run `NumberGuessingGame.java` (press **Shift + F6**).
3. Play and enjoy!

## Example Output

```Guess the number between 1 and 100:
50
Too low!
75
Too high!
63
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 tries.```
